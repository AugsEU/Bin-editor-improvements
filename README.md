# Credit to miluaces

Miluaces made this editor, all I did was add a few features. So full credit to him not me.

# Added features

* Fixed orthogonal mode. 

    Keybinds are the same as blender:

    Numpad1: front view

    Numpad3: side view

    Numpad7: top view

    Numpad5:switch in and out of orthogonal

* Added "Duplicate" and "Translate" buttons to the bin editor and improved UI

* Added Camera Intro editor(WIP)
